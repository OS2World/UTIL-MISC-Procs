PROCS.EXE lists all processes running in OS/2 2.0. It works with OS/2 2.0 and
is a 32-bit app, so it won't run on 1.x. If you want a version that runs on
1.x, E-Mail me and I'll send you my 16-bit version.

PROCS.EXE uses the undocumented API DosQProcStatus to get a list of running
processes - therefore its stability is in question because IBM could change
or remove this API without telling anyone. But this API stayed the same from
1.1 to 1.3 so I would doubt that the 2.0 version will change in any 2.x
release...

Usage: PROCS StartingPoint [ /f /i /s ]

Processes are sorted in Process Name, then Process ID order unless /i is used.
If /i is used, they are sorted in Process ID order.

Starting point is a string that indicates a process-name or partial
process-name from which to start listing processes. This is not valid if
/i is used.

/f fully qualifies the process names.

/s suppresses the 'More[Y/N]' messages that occur when the screen is about
to overflow. This is useful if redirecting to a file.

If you want a utility that kills processes by name or PID, KILLEM.EXE should
be available where you got PROCS.EXE. If not, let me know and I'll point out
where you could get it.

Any comments, suggestions, bug reports can be sent to my CIS id 72251,750.

Hope this utility proves useful.
